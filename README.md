# Reg-Form
Designed a registration form for a church that decided not to use since most of their members where not online.
Form has contact info section; workshop selection, box lunch selection, credit card payment section, billing address, conference fee and submit button.
Was created with HTML and CSS.
Would like to learn "back-side" to send confirmation email to registrant and create a report in order to compile the box lunch selections by quantity.
