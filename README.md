# Reg-Form
Designing a registration form for a church that decided most of their members where not online.
Chose to share my coding with some questions.
The workshops, box lunches and payments do not align up.
  Specifically: workshops and payments don't align with the rest of the form.
Set media queries and nothing changed.
Looking for asistance/guidance.
The coding is to show contact info; workshop selection; lunch selection; conference registration fee and where to send payment via check or credit card payment.
I do not know the back side to "connect" to accept cc payments.
