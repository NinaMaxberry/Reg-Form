# Reg-Form
Designed a registration form for a church that decided not to use since most of their members where not online.
Form has contact info section; workshop selection, box lunch selection, credit card payment section, billing address, conference fee and submit button.
Working towards learning "back-side" to sending confirmation email to registrant and also create a report in order to compile the box lunch selections by quantity for each registrants.
Working towards showing only pay by check information when the check box is checked for check payment (hide CC information).
Working towards adding the "pay by CC box to show required information and "hide" check payment information.
Working towards report with ALL registrant info (i.e, name, lunch selection, payment and email confirmation)
